so i wanted to setup a nextcloud;

it seemed strigth forward , but now i have to change the database settings 
becuase i wanted to use one central database


#secondary jail
pkg install nextcloud php56  mod_php56 apache24

echo "        Alias /nextcloud /usr/local/www/nextcloud
        AcceptPathInfo On
        <Directory /usr/local/www/nextcloud>
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
" >> /usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf

#and add 
<FilesMatch "\.php$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
<FilesMatch "\.phps$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
</FilesMatch>


#to your httpd.conf
# you should set 
ServerName
#and
ServerAdmin
#too

service apache24 restart
#now you can configure in the gui
